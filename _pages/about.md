I am a Postdoc Scientist in Amazon Robotics, working on perception problems for real-world systems.
I received my Ph.D. in in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by [Prof. Hui Guan](https://guanh01.github.io/).
Before coming to UMass, I got my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in the School of Software Engineering, Tongji University, advised by [Prof. Lin Zhang](https://cslinzhang.github.io/home/).
My research interests are Automated Machine Learning and Computer Vision and mainly focus on Multi-Task Learning and Diffusion Models.
