I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by [Prof. Hui Guan](https://guanh01.github.io/).
Before coming to UMass, I got my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in the School of Software Engineering, Tongji University, advised by [Prof. Lin Zhang](https://cslinzhang.gitee.io/home/).
My research interests are Automated Machine Learning and Computer Vision and mainly focus on Multi-Task Learning and Diffusion Models.

I will start my internship at Advanced Technology Group (ATG) in Dolby Laboratories this summer.
Previsouly, I was an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Robotics to work on multi-task model infrastructure construction. 

I'm actively looking for post-doc opportunity starting from 2025 Fall. Contact me if you are interested to learn more about me. Thank you!
